## Methods
Methods (sometimes also called functions) are blocks of code that can be run more than once and encapsulate a 

````groovy
def scores = [2, 7, 4, 3]
println "The average is ${determineAverage(scores)}"

def determineAverage(list) {
    return list.sum() / list.size()
}
````

### Testing and defensive coding
I'd like to tell you that your programming career will be all about writing perfect code that never has problems but I'd just be lying. 

````
assert determineAverage([5, 5, 8]) == 6
assert determineAverage([-10, 5, 2, 7]) == 1
````

We understand that `determineAverage(list)` is expecting a list of numbers and have used a reasonably clear naming strategy (`determineAverage`) to display that the method is number-oriented *but* what happens when our colleague gives us something like:

````
def data = [5, 5, 8, 'kitten']
determineAverage(data)
````

Clearly, _kittens_ aren't something that the _average_ calculation can understand. If you try to run that code you'll get a nasty error that basically says your code has failed. Don't be too hard on your colleague though - perhaps they've loaded data from a file that's become corrupted by felines.

What you can do though is to code defensively and make sure that `determineAverage` has some useful documentation such as: 

````groovy
/**
 * Determines the average for a list of numbers
 * @param   list  a list of numbers
 * @return the average of the numbers in the list
 */
def determineAverage(list) {
    return list.sum() / list.size()
}
````

In the example above I've just added a comment block that describes what the method does, its parameter and what it will return.

Next, I can make sure that the method has a prerequisite that needs to be met before it attempts to run.

SEE METHODS.GROOVY

````
/**
 * Determines the average for a list of numbers
 * @param   list  a list of numbers
 * @return        the average of the numbers in the list
 */
def determineAverage(list) {
    for (item in list) {
        if (! item instanceof Number) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException()
        }
        if (item instanceof String) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException()
        }
    }
    return list.sum() / list.size()
}

//assert determineAverage([5, 5, 8]) == 6
//assert determineAverage([-10, 5, 2, 7]) == 1

assert determineAverage([12, '18']) == 15

//def data = [5, 5, 8, 'kitten']
//determineAverage(data)
