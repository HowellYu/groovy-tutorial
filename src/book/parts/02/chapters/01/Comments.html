<h1 id="title">Comments</h1>

<p>Comments are used to clarify sections of Groovy code. 
Groovy supports two types of comments - single line and multi-line. </p>

<h2 id="single-linecomments">Single-line comments</h2>

<p>A single-line comment is introduced with two forward slash characters <code>//</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="groovy">//This is a single-line comment
</code></pre>

<p>Single-line comments can be appended to a Groovy statement:</p>

<pre><code>def radius = 10
def pi = 3.14 //This is not very precise
def area = pi * (radius * radius)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="multi-linecomments">Multi-line comments</h2>

<p>A multi-line comment is introduced by the characters <code>/*</code> and terminated with the characters <code>*/</code>. Generally, the <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> appear on their own line:</p>

<pre><code>/*
This is a multiline comment
and here is the second line
*/
</code></pre>

<p>Multi-line comments are most commonly formatted with an asterisk (<code>*</code>) on each line, aligned with the introductory asterisk as follows:</p>

<pre><code>/*
 * This is a multiline comment
 * and here is the second line
 */
</code></pre>

<p>Multi-line comments can be introduced and terminated on a single line:</p>

<pre><code>/* This is a multiline comment on a single line */
</code></pre>

<p>Nesting within a multi-line comment is not possible, rendering the following code invalid:</p>

<pre><code>/*
 * Multi-line comments cannot 
 * /* be nested */
*/
</code></pre>

<h2 id="usagetoavoid">Usage to avoid</h2>

<p>In a similar vein to single-line comments, multi-line comments can be appended to a statement. However, the single-line comment is generally more readable than the following example:</p>

<pre><code>def radius = 10
def pi = 3.14 /*This is not very precise*/
def area = pi * (radius * radius)
</code></pre>

<p>Even less expected is a multi-line comment appended to a statement in the following manner:</p>

<pre><code>def radius = 10
def pi = 3.14 /*This is not very precise
                and should really use java.lang.Math.PI
              */
def area = pi * (radius * radius)
</code></pre>

<p>In such a case the multi-line comment should appear above the statement being discussed:</p>

<pre><code>def radius = 10
/*
 * This is not very precise
 * and should really use java.lang.Math.PI
*/
def pi = 3.14 
def area = pi * (radius * radius)    
</code></pre>

<p>Use of a comment within a statement should never be contemplated as it results in code that is hard to read:</p>

<pre><code>def radius = 10
def pi = 3.14
def area = pi * /* I should find out how to square */ (radius * radius)
</code></pre>
