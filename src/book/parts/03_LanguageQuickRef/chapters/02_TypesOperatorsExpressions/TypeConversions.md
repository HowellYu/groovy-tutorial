## Type Conversions

Groovy will convert values assigned to variables into the variable's declared data type. For example, the code below declares a variable of type "String" and then assigns it 3.14 (a number). The assertion that the variable remains of type "String" will succeed, indicating that `3.14` was converted to a String value by Groovy before being assigned to the `myName` variable.

    def String myName = "Fred nurk"
    myName = 3.14
    assert myName.class == java.lang.String

Care must be taken to not rely totally on this automatic conversion. In the example below the assertion will fail as the `myPi` variable is declared as an `Integer` and the assignment drops the fractional component of `3.14`:

    def pi = 3.14
    def Integer myPi = pi
    assert myPi == pi
