## Comments

Comments are used to clarify sections of Groovy code. Groovy supports two types of comments - single line and multi-line. 

### Single-line comments
A single-line comment is introduced with two forward slash characters `//`:

    //This is a single-line comment
    
Single-line comments can be appended to a Groovy statement:

    def radius = 10
    def pi = 3.14 //This is not very precise
    def area = pi * (radius * radius)

### Multi-line comments
    
A multi-line comment is introduced by the characters `/*` and terminated with the characters `*/`. Generally, the `/*` and `*/` appear on their own line:

    /*
    This is a multiline comment
    and here is the second line
    */

Multi-line comments are most commonly formatted with an asterisk (`*`) on each line, aligned with the introductory asterisk as follows:

    /*
     * This is a multiline comment
     * and here is the second line
     */

Multi-line comments can be introduced and terminated on a single line:

    /* This is a multiline comment on a single line */

Nesting within a multi-line comment is not possible, rendering the following code invalid:

    /*
     * Multi-line comments cannot 
     * /* be nested */
    */
    
### Usage to avoid    
In a similar vein to single-line comments, multi-line comments can be appended to a statement. However, the single-line comment is generally more readable than the following example:

    def radius = 10
    def pi = 3.14 /*This is not very precise*/
    def area = pi * (radius * radius)
    
Even less expected is a multi-line comment appended to a statement in the following manner:

    def radius = 10
    def pi = 3.14 /*This is not very precise
                    and should really use java.lang.Math.PI
                  */
    def area = pi * (radius * radius)
    
In such a case the multi-line comment should appear above the statement being discussed:

    def radius = 10
    /*
     * This is not very precise
     * and should really use java.lang.Math.PI
    */
    def pi = 3.14 
    def area = pi * (radius * radius)    
    
Use of a comment within a statement should never be contemplated as it results in code that is hard to read:

    def radius = 10
    def pi = 3.14
    def area = pi * /* I should find out how to square */ (radius * radius)
