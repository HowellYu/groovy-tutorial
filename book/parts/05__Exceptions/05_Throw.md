title: 	Causing an Exception
description:	The `throw` keyword is used to intentionally cause an exception
...
 Often, `new` is used within a `throw` statement to initialise a new exception instance. The example below will `throw` a `new` instance of the `IllegalStateException`. As part of creating the new exception instance I pass it a message to help inform the user as to why they're getting an exception:

```groovy
def numerator = 10
def denominator = -1

try {
    if (denominator < 0) {
        throw new IllegalStateException('I haven\'t learnt how to divide negative numbers')
    } else {
        return numerator / denominator
    }
} catch (any) {
    println "${any.message} (${any.class})"
}
```

You can use `new` to create a new instance of an exception but this won't cause the exception to be thrown - you'll need to `throw` it. The long-form would appear as:

```groovy
def ise = new IllegalStateException('I haven\'t learnt how to divide negative numbers')
throw ise
```

>Use the short-form - it's more concise and it's what other developers expect to see.

In the code above I `throw` an exception (`IllegalStateException`) to indicate a limitation in my program. As before, the `catch` will receive the thrown exception but this time it could be either the `IllegalStateException` or the `ArithmeticException`:

```groovy
def numerator = 10
def denominator = -1

try {
    if (denominator < 0) {
        throw new IllegalStateException('I haven\'t learnt how to divide negative numbers')
    } else {
        return numerator / denominator
    }
} catch (IllegalStateException e) {
    println 'I just caught an IllegalStateException'
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    println 'I just caught an ArithmeticException'
} catch (any) {
    println 'What just happened?'
}
```

The code above makes a little more sense than some of my earlier examples as denominator may be `0` or a negative number and we are concerned with both possibilities. As mentioned earlier, we can use `|` to handle more than one exception type within the same `catch` block: 

```groovy
def numerator = 10
def denominator = -1

try {
    if (denominator < 0) {
        throw new IllegalStateException('I haven\'t learnt how to divide negative numbers')
    } else {
        return numerator / denominator
    }
} catch (IllegalStateException | ArithmeticException e) {
    println 'Stand back, I know how to handle this'
} catch (any) {
    println 'What just happened?'
}
```

# Constructing an Exception

There are a few approaches to constructing an exception, the main ones being:

`new IllegalStateException()`
: Creates a new instance without a message

`new IllegalStateException('Sorry, Dave, I cannot allow this')`
: Creates a new instance with a message

`new IllegalStateException('Sorry, Dave, I cannot allow this', e)`
: Creates a new instance with a message and provides the exception (`e`) that caused the exception you're now throwing.

Let's look at an example usage of the last variation. In the following code snippet I `catch` two possible exceptions and bundle `e` into a new exception instance but pass `e` to the new instance so that the caller could determine the cause:

```groovy
catch (IllegalStateException | ArithmeticException e) {
    throw new IllegalStateException('Unable to perform operation', e)
} 
```

Upon having the exception thrown at me I could use the `getCause()` method to determine if there was an underlying cause.
