## Objects
>We'll cover a lot more on Objects in a later tutorial as they're so central to Groovy. For now, this overview should help you get an understanding of how objects are used.

Groovy is an object-oriented programming language and it's essential to understand what this means if you're to really get to grips with coding. 

But what is an object? Well, an object is an encapsulation of properties and methods:

* __Properties__ are variables that hold data about the object
	* For example, a person object may have properties such as:
		* `name`
		* `email`
	* Properties are sometimes referred to as _fields_.
* __Methods__ are a means for accessing and manipulating the object's properties
	* For example a person object may have methods such as:
		* `getName()`
		* `setName(name)`
	* Methods can take parameters and/or return values. For example:
		* `getName()` would return the person's name
		* `setName(name)` takes 1 parameter (`name`) and sets the person's name to that value
	* Methods are sometimes (rarely) called _functions_

### Declaring and using an object

Let's look at a Groovy script that declares a new object:

<code-file url="src/person.groovy"><figcaption>
Example Person class
</figcaption></code-file>

An object is defined using the `class` keyword and it's best practice to using an uppercase letter for the first character:

```groovy
class Person {
```

>You'll note the `{` in the code. This is called a curly bracket and is used to denote a block of code. Each `{` has a partner `}` and are called the opening and closing brackets respectively. The opening bracket after `class Person` tells Groovy that all of the code up to the closing bracket relates to our definition of the Person class. We'll discuss this further in a coming tutorial.

We declare the two properties in much the same way as we do for any variable:

```groovy
def name
def email
```

A number of methods are declared to let us set and retrieve (get) the values of the  object's properties:

```groovy
def getName() {
    return this.name
}

def setName(name) {
    this.name = name
}

def getEmail() {
    return this.email
}

def seteEmail(email) {
    this.email = email
}
```

>Again you'll note the opening and closing brackets for each method, telling Groovy where the method definition opens and closes.

After we've declared the `Person` class we can now create instances of the class and assign values to the properties:

```groovy
def david = new Person(name: 'David', email: 'david@example.com')
```

We use `def david` as we would for other variables and then use `new Person` to indicated that `david` will hold an instance of the `Person` class. Lastly we call a special method called a _constructor_ that Groovy provides us for our objects: `(name: 'David', email: 'david@example.com')`. This sets up `david` with starting values for the properties.

>Constructors are basically methods but use the class name for the method name

At some point David changes his email address so we call the `setEmail` method: `david.setEmail('dave@example.com')`. You can see that the method call uses dot-point notation of `<variable name>.<method name>` - the dot (`.`) separates the variable name (`david`) from the method (`setEmail`).

Lastly, we use the two `get` methods to display `david`'s information: 

```groovy
println """\
Name:\t ${david.getName()}
Email:\t ${david.getEmail()}
"""
```

>That `println` code may be a little odd but we'll cover this shortly when we look at strings.

The example `Person` class has demonstrated a number of Groovy's object-oriented programming syntax:

1. Creating a new class with properties and methods
2. Creating a new instance of the class and calling its constructor
3. Changing (setting) and retrieving (getting) the instance's properties

You can create lots of `Person` instances and each will exist in their own context. This means that `david` and `sarah` don't get mixed up:

```groovy
def david = new Person(name: 'David', email: 'david@example.com')
def sarah = new Person(name: 'Sarah', email: 'sarah@example.com')
```

### Existing classes

The great strength/benefit/bonus of object-oriented programming is the vast array of existing libraries of objects that you can reuse in your code. In Groovy and Java the listing of these available objects are referred to as the Application Programming Interface (API)[^bookmarks]. 

If we were going to create a variable to hold a string (a piece of text) we would do something like:

```groovy
def quote = 'Well may we say "God save the Queen", because nothing will save the Governor-General!'
```

We could also use the following code to do exactly the same thing as the code above:

```groovy
def quote = new String('Well may we say "God save the Queen", because nothing will save the Governor-General!')
```

This looks similar to the way we created an instance of the `Person` class - we create a new instance of `String` and pass the text into the constructor.

>I prefer the first version as it's a lot easier to read but the example provided here lets you see that under Groovy's hood there's some helpful stuff going on to make you life easier.

Now that we have our `quote` string we actually also get a number of methods that help us handle our variable:

```groovy
//Display the quote in upper case letters
println quote.toUpperCase()

//Display the quote backwards
println quote.reverse()

//Display the number of characters in the quote
println quote.size()
```

The example above demonstrates how we can call methods on an object instance and you'll see this used in the rest of the tutorials. 

### Method calls on literal values
Literal values are best thought of the value you would write down:

* Boolean:
	* true
	* false
* Numbers:
	* 42
	* 3.14
* Strings (text):
	* 'hi there'

>We use quotes for string literals otherwise Groovy thinks the text is actually code and tries to interpret it.

We can call methods directly on literal values as Groovy will create an appropriate instance for us:

```groovy
assert 1.plus(1) == 2
```

This definitely looks a bit odd but think of it this way:

1. Groovy sees the literal value `1` followed by a method call
2. Groovy creates an number object instance for `1`
3. Groovy then calls the `plus` method against the new number instance

>`1.plus(1)` also looks odd because we're used to seeing `1 + 1`. Both formats are supported but the latter is easier to read.

This can start to be very useful when you look at lists and ranges - something we'll get to soon. 

### Summary
We won't much deeper into objects for now but I hope this section makes the syntax a little less confusing.
