# Built in Libraries

The following libraries are imported into Groovy by default:

- `java.io.*`
- `java.lang.*`
- `java.math.BigDecimal`
- `java.math.BigInteger`
- `java.net.*`
- `java.util.*`
- `groovy.lang.*`
- `groovy.util.*`

Groovy score is able to make use of classes within these packages without explicitly importing them.

## Useful third-party libraries
There is an extensive body of existing Java libraries available to the Groovy developer and it's best to do some investigating before you write your own code - re-using well-supported libraries is a real time saver.
