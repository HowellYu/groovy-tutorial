## Equality Operators
[Table: The equality operators]
|Operator|Name     
|:------:|:--------
|==      |Equal to 
|!=      |Not equal to

The equality operators return a boolean (`true` or `false`) result from a comparison. All of the following comparisons evaluate as being `true`

```groovy
assert -99 == -99
assert 'koala' == 'koala'
assert 'cat' != 'dog'
assert 6 != 7

def domesticAnimal = 'dog'
def wildAnimal = 'lion'
assert domesticAnimal != wildAnimal

def str1 = 'Hello'
def str2 = 'Hello'
assert str1 == str2
```

### Precedence
In the following example, the equality operator (`!=`) is evaluated before the assignment operator (`=`), resulting in the value of `truth` being the boolean value `true`:

```groovy
def truth = 'cats' != 'dogs'
assert truth == true
```
