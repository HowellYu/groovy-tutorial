[^terms]

[^terms]: Whilst I tend to use the terms "function" and "method" somewhat interchangeably when discussing Groovy, people discussing closures more generally use the term "function". Some languages have very specific meanings for terms such as "function", "procedure", "method" but I'd suggest that if you use the term "method" or "function" that most Java and Groovy developers will get your meaning. Alternatively, you could try to be more universal and call them all "subroutines"
