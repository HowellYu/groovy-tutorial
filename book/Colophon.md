title:	Colophon  
...
A number of technologies were used in the production of this book:

- The code is, of course, primarily written using the Groovy distribution
- The book is assembled using a small Gradle-based Groovy application I strung together.
	- You can find the source [here](https://bitbucket.org/groovytutorial/book-definition) 
- [MultiMarkdown Composer](http://multimarkdown.com/) was used as my primary editor
- The text has been converted using the [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) tool.
- The [Groovy/Grails Tool Suite](http://grails.org/products/ggts) was used to test some of the sample code.

I wish I had a 19th century engraving on the cover so that I could tell you about a really cool animal. If I did I would use the [Pied butcherbird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_butcherbird), perhaps accompanied with a picture from one of [John Gould's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gould) books. I would then tell you that this small-ish bird has a beautiful song and a really friendly composure. My resident (wild) butcherbirds like to sing on my deck when it's raining, follow me when I mow and, occasionally, bathe under the sprinkler on hot days.
