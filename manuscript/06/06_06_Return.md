# Return value

I> Most methods are built to return an answer.

When we started this tutorial I provided a very basic method for calculating averages. I've rewritten it slightly to use varargs and this is a good starting point into using the `return` statement:


	println determineAverage(10, 20, 30, 40)
	
	def determineAverage(... list) { 
	    return list.sum() / list.size()
	}


In the code above I `return` the average to the caller so, instead of printing out the result I could also assign it to a variable: `def avg = determineAverage(10, 20, 30, 40)`.

Using the `return` reserved word isn't required as Groovy will return the result of the last statement:


	println determineAverage(10, 20, 30, 40)
	
	def determineAverage(... list) { 
	    list.sum() / list.size()
	}


You can use `return` to explicitly exit a method. By itself, `return` actually returns `null`. In the useless method I provide below, I explicitly provide `return`:


	def printer(message) {
	    println message
	    return
	}
	
	printer('hello, world')


That use of `return` in the last bit of code was redundant as the method would exit anyway (it had nothing left to do). However, this can be handy if the last expression to run in a method returns a value that _we don't want_ as the return value for our method.

Anything after a return is inaccessible, as illustrated by my even more useless method:


	def printer(message) {
	    println message
	    return
	    println 'Help, I don\'t exist'
	}


That last line in the method will never, ever, ever be called. __But__ if I really wanted it to be called I can use the `try-finally` approach:


	def printer(message) {
	    try{
	        println message
	        return
	    } finally {
	        println 'Help, I don\'t exist'
	    }
	}


Now, that last bit of text will be displayed as it's in a `finally` block. This example is rather daft but it serves to illustrate how `finally` can be used to clean up something like an open file before the `return` is actioned.

## Multiple Returns

You can have more than one `return` statement in a method but only one will ever be evaluated. This is really handy as it localises the return and prevents the method from further evaluation. You can also place a `return` at the very end of the method block to ensure that the method always returns a value. In the code below I use two `return` statements in the `switch` but also have `return false` at the bottom of the method just in case something slips through (most likely when I add in code at a later date):


	def checkAnimalAsPet(animal) {
	    switch(animal){
	        case 'dog':
	        case 'cat':
	            return true
	        default:
	            return false   
	    }
	    return false
	}
	
	assert checkAnimalAsPet('cat') 
	assert checkAnimalAsPet('dog')
	assert checkAnimalAsPet('lion') == false
	assert checkAnimalAsPet('pterodactyl') == false


You'll note that, in the `checkAnimalAsPet` method I have a `switch` with no breaks. Essentially, the `return` is breaking out of the switch and the method all at once.

## Declaring data types for return values

A data type can be declared for the return value by replacing `def` with the class name: 
e.g. `Number determineAverage(... list){..}`:
	
	Number determineAverage(... list) { 
	    return list.sum() / list.size()
	}
	
	println determineAverage(10, 20, 30, 40)


This is very handy if your method is to be accessed as part of an API, especially by Java programs.

You may notice some methods defined with a return type of `void`. This indicates that the method won't return a value:

	void displayText() {
    	println 'Hello, World'
	}

I can still use `return` within the method - I just can't return a value.

## Sequential method calls

In many examples I have used a method's returned value to set a value of a variable, in an `assert` or as the input to a `println`. As the return value has its own type, we can actually call a method straight from the method call. This can be useful if one method call is just an intermediary step towards our goal and we don't want to explicitly store its return value.

In the example below I call the `tokenize` method which returns a List of the words in the `poem` I then call the `size` method for that list to determine how many words are in the poem:

	def poem = '''\
	Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong
	Under the shade of a coolibah tree,
	And he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled:
	"Who'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me?"
	'''
	
	poem.tokenize().size()

T> `poem?.tokenize()?.size()`
