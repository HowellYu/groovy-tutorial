# Increment and Decrement Operators

I> Number goes up. Number goes down.

The increment operator increments a value to its next value. When you increment or decrement a variable using `++` or `--` the variable is modified to the new value.

{title="Inc and dec"}
|Operator|Name	|
|:------:|:--------|
|++      |Increment	|
|--      |Decrement	|


The increment and decrement operators come in two flavours, prefix and postfix:

* Prefixes are assessed _before_ the statement is evaluated
	* `assert ++5 == 6`
* Postfixes are assessed _after_ the statement is evaluated
	* `assert 5++ == 5`

{title="Using inc and dec",lang=Java}
	assert 10++ == 10
	assert ++10 == 11
	assert --10 == 9
	assert 10-- == 10


The increment and decrement behaves differently depending on the type of value being used.

**Booleans** don't increment/decrement

**Numbers** increment/decrement by 1:

	def num = 10
	num++
	assert num == 11

**Characters** move to the previous (`--`) or next (`++`) character:

	def ch = 'c'
	ch--
	assert ch == 'b'

**Strings** are a little odd and it is the last character in the string that is affected:

	def str = 'hello'
	str++
	assert str == 'hellp'

**Enums[^enums]** will cycle through the enum values:

	enum Priority {
	    LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
	}
	def task = Priority.LOW
	task++
	assert task == Priority.MEDIUM

[^enums]: We'll [get to Enums much later](#chenums).

**BUT** be aware that you'll cycle back to the beginning of the value list. The following example is a good example of where you can easily get caught out:

	def task = Priority.LOW
	task--
	assert task == Priority.HIGH


## Overloading the Increment and Decrement Operators

By overloading `next` and `previous` methods, a custom class can support the increment and decrement operators.

The example below demonstrates a class that increments/decrements by 2:

{title="Overloading increment and decrement",lang=Java}
	class StepTwo extends Object {
	    def value

	    StepTwo(val) {
	        this.value = val
	    }


	    def next() {
	        value += 2
	        return this
	    }

	    def previous() {
	        value -= 2
	        return this
	    }

	    String toString() {
	        return "I have a value of ${this.value}"
	    }
	}

	def two = new StepTwo(3)
	println two
	two++
	println two
	two--
	println two
