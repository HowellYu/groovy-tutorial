## The Shapes demo
Throughout this section I'll build up an example library for working with two-dimensional shapes. You'll see these
in each of the following chapters under the __The shapes demo__ sub-heading.

To support the information in this section I've setup the [http://www.groovy-tutorial.org/shapes-demo/](shapes demo)
mini site. This provides a number of handy resources:

* A guide to building (compiling) the code both directly using `groovyc` and with the [http://gradle.org/](Gradle build tool).
* Links to download the code
* Various reports on the code

Once you've read through the chapters in this section, head to the [http://www.groovy-tutorial.org/shapes-demo/](shapes demo)
 mini site and give it a try.
