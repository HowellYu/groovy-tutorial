# Introduction

I like Groovy.

I like the way it lets me use the Java skills I've built up over the years but it makes it easier to code solutions to problems. I like the way it doesn't, well, get in the way. With Groovy I can:

- Easily code small scripts to perform command-line tasks
- Tie together existing systems and libraries - leveraging the breadth and depth of existing Java-based projects
- Write entire applications that can be deployed onto any system running the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) - without having to tell people the code isn't in Java.

Groovy programs run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the JVM is installed across a huge spectrum of systems: desktops, servers, mobiles and the Internet of Things. Importantly, the Java world has been going through a great renewal phase. Where once the JVM and the Java programming language were almost synonyms, a range of JVM-based languages have appeared: Groovy, [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), [Jython](http://www.jython.org/). These aren't languages that run within a Java program (though many can do just that), these are languages that compile down to JVM bytecode and run in a way that means you don't even need to tell your SysAdmin that you didn't write it in Java. What's more, we're not at the "cutting edge" of this approach - it's been going for long enough that you can expect a level of stability that supports the use of these languages in real application development.

In the following sections I aim to guide you through the basics of Groovy. I haven't really focussed on writing a "How to program" guide nor do I expend a lot of words comparing Groovy with Java. You may also notice that I haven't included the output of most of the code examples - this is to save some clutter in the text and encourage you pop open a groovyConsole and try the code for yourself. Go on, you know you'll love it.

I really hope that this tutorial gives you a basis in understanding the Groovy language and I hope that you start to see why I like Groovy so much.

Enjoy!

Q> ## Did you know?
Q> As of March 2015 Groovy entered the incubation phase at Apache?
Q> This is the first step towards having Groovy become a full-blown Apache project.

## Something Wrong?

If you find something wrong I'd really appreciate you letting me know via the [GitHub issue system](https://github.com/groovy-tutorial/groovy-tutorial/issues). Please remember that I'm not a big corporation or an automaton - I can't  respond immediately to queries and I am an assemblage of emotions that respond well to positive encouragement a lot better than negativity.

## Bookmarks

Between Groovy and Java there's a lot of useful websites - this is a few key ones you'll want to have in your browser.

Core resources to have at-hand:

- [The Groovy homepage](http://www.groovy-lang.org/) is a great starting point.
- The latest Groovy API documents are available at:
	- [The Groovy API](http://groovy-lang.org/api.html) - aka the GAPI
	- [The Groovy extensions to the JDK](http://groovy-lang.org/gdk.html) - aka the GDK
- The [Java API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/) always comes in handy
	- So do [The Java Tutorials](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
- Whilst not a perfect fit for Groovy, I tend to use the [Google Java Style](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html) as my stern mentor.

I've been establishing [www.groovy-tutorial.org](http://www.groovy-tutorial.org/) to supplement this book with practical
Groovy tutorials. Keep an eye out for new content!

Great blogs and sites that provide Groovy coding examples:

- [Mr Haki](http://mrhaki.blogspot.com.au/search/label/Groovy) - A really useful site containing heaps of Groovy code examples.
- [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/groovy) - Another useful site for Groovy articles.

The book [Groovy in Action (2nd Edition)](http://www.manning.com/koenig2/) will help you go further with your Groovy programming.

If you find yourself stuck and needing some help, the following channels are worth tuning into:

- [StackOverflow's Groovy tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/groovy) is really useful
	- search for an answer before posting a question
	- Check out their article "[How do I ask a good question?](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)" - it's an excellent outline for asking in a way people may answer
- The [Groovy Mailing lists](http://groovy-lang.org/mailing-lists.html) are also worth joining and searching

I suggest to anyone within the orbit of Java that "Effective Java (2nd edition)" by Joshua Bloch should not only be read (repeatedly) but always at-hand.

## Conventions Used in This Book

I've tried to present this book in a manner that will suit both the reader that likes a linear path of front-to-back and those who like to dip in on specific items.

### Code

Code is displayed using a `monospaced` font.

Code presented within regular language looks something like:

> Use of `println` as your primary testing framework is discouraged.

Blocks of code are presented as follows:

{title="A block of code",lang=Java}
	def name = "Billy"
	println "Hi there $name"

Some code doesn't feature a title and is presented so as to be more aligned with the flow of the text:

	def name = "Billy"
	println "Hi there $name"

I've opted not to display line numbers with code as it makes copy and paste difficult.

### Asides

I use a variety of asides to note information. These appear with an icon and some text and, on most occasions, feature a title.

I> ## An informative message
I> These provide some extra context

T> ## A tip
T> These are handy tips

W> ## A warning message
W> These point out things to worry about

## Your Rights and This Book
I'm making the "Groovy Tutorial" freely available because I feel that open source projects such as Groovy deserve to have a variety of documentation that helps people use open source software. This body of work is one that took a significant amount of unpaid time but I have benefitted from many people's work in developing open source software and the associated, freely available text, that they make available.
