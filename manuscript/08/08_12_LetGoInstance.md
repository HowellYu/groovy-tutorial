# Let Go of That Instance!

Sometimes your variable (e.g. a class instance) can end up holding a large amount of data. For example, you might have placed the text of the complete works of Shakespeare into a property. The JVM performs a process called _Garbage Collection_ so as to clean up data that you are no longer using. By assigning a variable to `null` we flag that the data previously held by the variable is no longer needed:

	myInstance = null

For small Groovy scripts this may never be an issue but, for long running applications, data hanging around and not being used can start to soak up a serious amount of resources, especially memory. Once you've finished with a variable it's worth assigning its value to `null` to let the JVM know you don't need it anymore.

You don't always need to explicitly set variables to `null` - this would make your code far less readable. The JVM knows that once a variable is no longer in scope, it's no longer accessible and, thus, is no longer needed. This means that if you have a variable declared inside a method, its value is no longer needed once the method has completed. The same goes for variables declared within scopes such as loops. This can get a bit tricky when regarding closures and object references so it's not all plain sailing.

There is an important caveat: if multiple variables refer to the same data then the JVM can only release resources once all references have "unlatched". Let's examine this in the code below:

{lang=groovy}
<<[Example of multiple references to the same data](code/08/12/let_go.groovy)

I've defined a variable (`shakespeare`) to hold a new instance of the `SampleText` class and then said that another variable (`marlow`) points to that instance of `SampleText`. My call to `marlow.text` will still work despite my setting `shakespeare` to `null`. In this case we say that "`marlow` still holds a reference to the `SampleText` instance". This means that the JVM can't release the resources held by the instance until all references are set to `null`. I need to set `marlow` to `null` to completely release the resources.

T> ## Keeping track of references
T> Building up unused references to data is how a program will use up all of your JVM's memory and slowing everything to a crawl over time. When you have variables or collections of variables (such as lists) that you keep and add to over a long period of time you need to make sure you clean up what you don't need.

There's a lot more to garbage collection than I want to cover here but if you spend a few moments searching "Java Garbage Collection" you'll be able to delve deep into the topic.
