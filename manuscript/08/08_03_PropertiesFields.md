# Properties and Fields {#chpropertiesfields}

I> _What is your substance, whereof are you made?_ ([Sonnet 53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet_53))

In this chapter we'll delve more into properties and fields. They're *almost* the same thing and are known more generally as [member variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_variable) as they hold data regarding the state of an object instance. In less technical terms, they help describe a specific instance (e.g. *Jim*) of a class (*Person*).

## Properties
The class below is composed of three properties and could be used to pass a person's details around in a system. You may come across references to this type of structure as "Groovy beans":

{lang=groovy}
<<[A basic person class with three properties](code/08/03/properties_example.groovy)

In the code above I create a new instance of the `Person` class by calling `new Person()` and can then access each property using dot-point notation. This type of class can be really handy when you just need a structure for storing and handing around data - say, for example, you load a record from a database and want to feed it to other classes and their methods for processing.

T> ## `Person` is a type
T> I could have used `Person astrid = new Person()`

Groovy provides a built-in approach to passing in property values when creating a new instance. The code below creates a new `Person` but sets the property values using [named arguments](#chnamedarguments):

    def astrid = new Person(name: 'Astrid Smithson', email: 'astrid@example.com', mobile: '0418 111 222')

We don't have to set all of the properties, just the ones we need:

    def astrid = new Person(name: 'Astrid Smithson', email: 'astrid@example.com')

T> ## This looks like a method call
T> You're absolutely correct - `new Person()` calls a special type of method called a constructor. We'll cover these in the next chapter: [Constructors](#chconstructors). For now, know that Groovy provides this method for you.

### Viewing an object's properties/fields
If you try to use `println` to display the details for `astrid` you'll get something like `Person@46423706`. It's not very useful - just the type of the Object and an identifier. If you want to find out the field values, call the `dump` method that all objects inherit from `Object`:

    println astrid.dump()

### Typed properties

Just as we saw [with variables](#chvariables_datatypes), properties can be defined with a specific data type, rather than with a dynamic type. The code below redefines the `Person` class with typed properties:

{title="A basic person class with three typed properties",lang=groovy}
    class Person {
        String name
        String email
        String mobile
    }

T> ## Use `def` _or_ a type, not both
T> Whilst `def String name` would work, the `def` is redundant and, by dropping it, you save four keystrokes for something more useful!

People often ask if they should just use `def` or assign an explicit type. My answer is pretty straight-forward: if you know how you'll use it and you'll only use it one way, give it a type. The `name` property is a good example  and I would use `String`. In other situations you may want to be flexible in what you can store so use `def`.

## Fields

A _field_ is pretty much the same thing as a _property_ - it's a member variable - but there's a difference: _fields_ are defined with an access modifier and _properties_ are not. An access modifier is used to allow/block access from other code using the class and its member variables and methods.

Q> ## Access modifiers?
Q> [Access modifiers](#chaccessmodifiers) are covered very soon in their own chapter. However, the purpose of the two main access modifiers should be reasonably easy to deduce. `private` is used to hide the element from outside code and should only be accessible by the object itself. `public` is the opposite and allows anyone to access the element.

In the code below I have rewritten the `Person` class using fields rather than properties:

{title="A basic person class with three fields",lang=groovy}

    class Person {
        public name
        private email
        private mobile
    }

Firstly, you'll see that I haven't used the `def` keyword - I don't need to do this when I provide an access modifier. I could have declared `public def name` but it's not good style as the `def` is implied. We can specify a type for a field by stating the type after the access modifier:

{title="A basic person class with three typed fields",lang=groovy}

    class Person {
        public String name
        private String email
        private String mobile
    }

T> ##Use typed fields for larger programs
T> If you're writing code that others will use then definitely use fields. Using types is up to you but they do help other developers know what you're expecting.

## Default values
Properties and fields are much like variables and can be declared with an initial value:

{title="A basic person class with three typed fields, each with an initial value",lang=groovy}

    class Person {
        public String name = 'anonymous'
        private String email = 'anon@example.com'
        private String mobile = ''
    }

The initial value doesn't have to be a literal, it can be determined from an expression.

## Casting maps to objects

Groovy gives bean-style objects a really interesting approach to casting[^cast] a map or a list to an object. Let's get
an example going first:

{lang=groovy}
<<[Using a map to create a new instance](code/08/03/basic_mapcast.groovy)

For the first person (`astrid`) I explicitly cast the map to a Person instance using
`[name: 'Astrid Smithson', email: 'astrid@example.com'] as Person`. Groovy creates a new instance of `Person` and calls
the `name` and `email` setters.

In the case of `gretchen` I don't need to call `as Person` as Groovy infers this from the fact I declared the variable's
type (`Person gretchen`).

[^cast]: Remember the [`as` operator](#chobjectoperators)?
