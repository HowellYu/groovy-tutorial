I wish I had a 19th century engraving on the cover so that I could tell you about a really cool animal. If I did I would use the [Pied butcherbird](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_butcherbird), perhaps accompanied with a picture from one of [John Gould's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gould) books. I would then tell you that this small-ish bird has a beautiful song and a really friendly composure. My resident (wild) butcherbirds like to sing on my deck when it's raining, follow me when I mow and, occasionally, bathe under the sprinkler on hot days.
